## Introduction

This project aims to create an accurate statistical model to predict the future energy consumption of France, with a target precision of over 90%. To achieve this goal, we will utilize various techniques in data analysis, time series, and statistical modeling.

## Objectives

- Develop a statistical model with over 90% accuracy to predict the future energy consumption of France.
- Utilize analysis and time series libraries for data manipulation and modeling.

## Libraries

- **Analysis**: Use of data analysis libraries to explore and understand the data.
- **Time Series**: Utilization of specialized libraries for the manipulation and analysis of time series data.

## Data Access

- **Data Information**: Access to information regarding the data used for modeling.
- **Data Queries**: Access and retrieval of necessary data for analysis and modeling.

## Univariate Analysis of Energy Consumption

- **Data Cleaning**: Identification and treatment of missing, duplicate, and outlier data.
- **Outlier Detection Methods**: Employment of techniques to detect and handle outliers in the data.

###### I also conduct analysis on a time series derived from the yfinance API, focusing on historical stock prices for Zalando. If you're interested, you can explore my other project titled  : [Zalando Stock Actions Analysis](https://github.com/CatelloTheDataProjectManager/Time-Series/blob/main/README.md)

## Normality and Stationarity Testing

- **Normality Testing**: Verification of the normality of data distribution.
- **Stationarity Testing**: Checking the stationarity of time series data.

## Dependency and Correlation

- **Series Decomposition**: Analysis of trend, seasonality, and noise in time series data.
- **Partial Correlation and Autocorrelation**: Evaluation of correlation between variables and autocorrelation in time series data.

## Bivariate or Multivariate Statistical Analysis

- **Covariance of Consumption with Other Variables**: Assessment of the relationship between energy consumption and other variables.
- **Smoothing Model**: Use of smoothing models to reduce noise and identify trends in data.
- **ARIMA Model**: Employment of the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series modeling and prediction.

## Conclusion

This project aims to deliver a robust statistical model for predicting the future energy consumption of France. By employing a systematic approach to data analysis and statistical modeling, we aim to achieve prediction accuracy exceeding 90%.
