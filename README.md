## Introduction

This project aims to create an accurate statistical model to predict the future energy consumption of France, with a target precision of over 90%. To achieve this goal, we will utilize various techniques in data analysis, time series, and statistical modeling.

###### (Modeling and Multivariate Regression are essential tools for understanding how these pre-trained models work and how they can be effectively used to solve complex natural language processing problems.

## Objectives

- Develop a statistical model with over 90% accuracy to predict the future energy consumption of France.
- Utilize analysis and time series libraries for data manipulation and modeling.

## Univariate Analysis of Energy Consumption

- Identification and treatment of missing, duplicate, and outlier data.
- Employment of techniques to detect and handle outliers in the data.

## Normality and Stationarity Testing

- Verification of the normality of data distribution.
- Checking the stationarity of time series data.

## Dependency and Correlation

- Analysis of trend, seasonality, and noise in time series data.
- Evaluation of correlation between variables and autocorrelation in time series data.

## Bivariate or Multivariate Statistical Analysis

- Assessment of the relationship between energy consumption and other variables.
- Use of smoothing models to reduce noise and identify trends in data.
- Employment of the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series modeling and prediction.
